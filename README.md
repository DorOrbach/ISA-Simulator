# ISA-Simulator
The project description and demands can be seen at project_271121 file.
A project from the course "Computers Architecture" of Tel-Aviv university, which simulates the operation of a processor. 
required:
1. An assembly program writen according to the ISA given in "project_271121" file, and interpeted to hexa decimal representation.
Bugs:
1. Missing output files.
2. Different cores cannot share memory directly.

The program is writen as a singel process but a better implementation would have been to use a multithread application, when each thread
simulates the run of a different core of the processor.
